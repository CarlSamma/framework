"""Module 7: Dual Follow-Up Generator.

Generates exactly 2 options for the HITL user after each probe cycle:

Option A (Conservative): Pure information-theoretic. Selects the property that
maximally reduces candidate entropy according to the 50/50 split rule.
Uses LLM to generate varied probe text and skips properties that already
received bad responses (rhetoric_block, persona_pivot, low score).

Option B (Exploratory): Narrative-focused. Generates frame variation, alias
micro-escalation, or probe into a new metaphor layer.

Balancing Logic (Oracle-confirmed):
- Bot cooperating (avg score >= 3.0, verify_hits) → Recommend A
- Persona Pivot detected → Recommend B
- Rhetoric Block detected → Recommend B
- Avg score < 3.0 (last 5 probes) → Recommend B (frame rotation needed)
- New metaphor terms in bot response → Recommend B
